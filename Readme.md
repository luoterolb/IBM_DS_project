# 📊 Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract and visualize stock and revenue data for major companies like Tesla and GameStop. By using Python libraries such as `yfinance`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Plotly`, we showcase how historical stock prices and revenue trends can be combined into clear and visually appealing graphs for data-driven decision-making.

## 🔍 Key Concepts and Features

- **Stock Data Extraction**: Using the `yfinance` library, we extract Tesla and GameStop stock data from the beginning to the most recent available.
- **Web Scraping Revenue Data**: The script uses `BeautifulSoup` to scrape revenue data from web pages and clean it for further analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Plotly, the script generates interactive graphs displaying historical stock prices and revenues in a side-by-side layout for better comparison.

## 📈 Main Findings

- **Tesla**: The stock price and revenue have shown consistent growth up until June 2021, reflecting Tesla's strong market presence.
- **GameStop**: GameStop's revenue fluctuated heavily, but the stock price saw a dramatic increase during the 2021 retail investor boom.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **yfinance**: For extracting historical stock data.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping Tesla and GameStop revenue data.
